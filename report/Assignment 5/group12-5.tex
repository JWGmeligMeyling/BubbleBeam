%  MULTIPLE GAME MODES
% ==========================
\subsection{Multiple game modes}
In the previous sprint we introduced serveral game modes (from requirements \texttt{M-191} to \texttt{M-194}). A Game Mode basically defines what kind of bubbles a player can receive in his cannon. We've implemented several \textit{Power-up Bubbles} (bubbles with a special effect). These Bubbles are constructed through a \texttt{BubbleFactory}, and the Game Mode was basically implemented by providing the \texttt{GameController} with another \texttt{BubbleFactory}.

\par{}Ofcourse it's a bit ambigious to let the \texttt{BubbleFactory} be the object that decides the \texttt{GameMode}. It also was a bit limited: we could provide new bubbles, but a more advanced game mode - Timed Game Mode (\texttt{M-193}) - actually failed because we had no possibility to hook on to the required methods - translating the bubbles - and events - time.

\par{}Speaking of events, over time, the game controller logic became a bit cluttered, after adding hooks and observers/listeners in various ways. Thus, in this sprint, we refactored the event handling system as a starting point for the more advanced game modes and multiplayer improvements.

% ==============================
% 	EVENT HANDLING
% ==============================
\subsubsection{Event handling}
\label{sec:evthdl}

We already use event handling a lot: the \texttt{CannonController} triggers a \texttt{CannonShootEvent} (which is itself most likely triggered by an \texttt{MouseEvent}). The \texttt{GameController} listens for this \texttt{CannonShootEvent} and then starts doing its responsibility: allow the \texttt{MovingBubble} to move and check if it collides with other bubbles on its way, and if so, handle this collision in terms of snapping to the \texttt{BubbleMesh}, or popping with other bubbles.

\par All these actions are in fact events as well, and provide perfect hooks for game mode implementations and  synchronization in the multiplayer. However, in the current version, this eventing system was just not complete enough to make this true. Luckily, the changes don't require a lot of new classes to be introduced, but rather requires to move around a few methods between classes and update their callers.

\subsubsection*{BubbleMesh}
The \texttt{BubbleMesh} is a data structure for the \texttt{Bubbles}, and this structure needs to be maintained as bubbles gets snapped in to the mesh, popped, or inserted at the top. These events can be useful, as points need to be rewarded when bubbles pop. Also, when rows get inserted to the mesh, we want to send this to a potential multiplayer client.

\subsubsection*{CannonController}
The \texttt{CannonController} is responsible for the cannon specific logic. It triggers an event when the cannon shoots, which for example is necessary for the \texttt{GameController} to start translating the shot bubble.

% ========================
% GAME MODE 
% ========================
\subsubsection{Game Mode}
\label{sec:gmmde}
From the requirements \texttt{M-191} to \texttt{M-194} we expect a \texttt{Game Mode} to have the following abilities: (1) it should be able to provide a certain \texttt{BubbleFactory} to the \texttt{GameController}, so that it can create the correct ammunation for the game mode; (2) it should be able to listen for \texttt{GameEvents}, for example to award points or insert new bubbles after a few misses; and (3) it should be able to listen on \texttt{GameTicks} to perform changes over time, such as pushing bubbles slowly to the bottom in the timed mode. Furthermore, we need to have access to the \texttt{GameController} to invoke these actions, and we also need to add some calls to the \texttt{GameModel} in the \texttt{GameController}.

\begin{figure}[H]
    \begin{center}
    \begin{tabular}{ | p{8cm} | p{4cm} | }
      \multicolumn{2}{c}{\texttt{GameMode}} \\ \hline
      \textbf{Responsibilities} & \textbf{Collaborations} \\ \hline
      Provide a \texttt{BubbleFactory} & \texttt{BubbleFactory} \\
      Listen for \texttt{GameEvents} & \texttt{GameController} \\
      Interact with \texttt{BubbleMesh} & \texttt{BubbleMesh} \\
      Interact with \texttt{GameControler} & \texttt{GameTick} \\
      Ability to hook onto \texttt{GameTicks} & \\
      \hline
    \end{tabular}
    \end{center}
    \caption{CRC-Card for the \texttt{GameMode}}
\end{figure}

Since we want a \texttt{GameMode} to hook onto \texttt{GameEvents}, we decided it should be a \texttt{GameListener}. Because we also want to hook on \texttt{GameTicks}, we decided a \texttt{GameMode} should also be \texttt{Tickable}. For the \texttt{BubbleFactory} and name of the \texttt{GameMode}, we defined getters in the \texttt{GameMode} interface.

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{GameMode.png}
    \caption{UML class diagram for the \texttt{GameMode}}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection*{Interactions}
The \texttt{ClassicGameMode} provides bubbles through the \texttt{DefaultBubbleFactory} (which creates only \texttt{ColouredBubbles} and no Power-up bubbles), this is provided through the \texttt{getBubbleFactory} method. When bubbles pop, the player is awarded some points. This is achieved by overriding the \texttt{pop} method from the \texttt{GameListener}. When a shot bubble snaps into the \texttt{BubbleMesh} without popping, it's concidered a miss. After a few misses, a new row is inserted. The same as with the pop, this is done by implementing the \texttt{shotMissed} method. See also the sequence diagram \ref{fig:seqgamemode} for these interactions between the \texttt{GameMode} and the \texttt{GameController}.

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{ClassicGameMode.png}
    \caption{UML sequence diagram for the \texttt{GameMode}}
    \label{fig:seqgamemode}
\end{figure}

% ==============================
% 	BUBBLE MESH IMPROVEMENTS
% ==============================
\subsubsection{BubbleMesh improvements}
In the previous iteration a \texttt{Bubble} knew it's position and was able to paint itself on a \texttt{Graphics} object. In the \texttt{paintComponent} function of the \texttt{GamePanel} we iterate over all bubbles in the \texttt{BubbleMesh}, and invoke the \texttt{render} method.
For the \texttt{TimedGameMode}, this was not enough. In the \texttt{TimedGameMode} we want all bubbles to slowly fall down at a certain speed. When they reach the bottom, the game is over, or when the \texttt{BubbleMesh} is empty, you have defeated the game mode. We needed to be able to translate the entire \texttt{BubbleMesh}.

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{BubbleMeshSprite.png}
    \caption{UML class diagram for the \texttt{BubbleMesh} }
    \label{fig:bmeshsprite}
\end{figure}

We figured out that it would be more clear to let the \texttt{BubbleMesh} be a \texttt{Sprite} as well, and give it the ability to draw itself and it's bubbles. Then the \texttt{GamePanel} calls the render method of the \texttt{BubbleMesh} instead of the induvidual bubbles. Also we gave the \texttt{BubbleMesh} a position which can be translated - also moving the bubbles in the \texttt{BubbleMesh}.

\par{} With these adjustments to the \texttt{BubbleMesh} and the event listener changes described in section \ref{sec:evthdl} and \ref{sec:gmmde}, we now have all the ingredients to make the \texttt{TimedGameMode} work: in the \texttt{GameMode} we can now hook onto the \texttt{GameTick} and then slightly translate the \texttt{BubbleMesh}.

% ==============================
% 	GAME MODES FOR MULTIPLAYER
% ==============================
\subsubsection{Game modes for multiplayer}
In the previous version we basically only transmitted the \texttt{CannonEvents} and some \texttt{BubbleMesh} syncs, and let the client then guess what other events might have been triggered. Also, we just hard coded to always pick the \texttt{PowerUpBubbleFactory} (so what now would be the \texttt{PowerUpGameMode}). This did not give us the ability to play other \texttt{GameModes}, or use any of the Game Mode logic introduced in section \ref{sec:gmmde}.

\par{}Therefore we decided to rework the multiplayer. First, when we create a room (player 1 clicks "start multiplayer"), we want to be able to select one of the \texttt{GameModes}. Then we want to create two \texttt{GameModels} with this \texttt{GameMode} and an initial \texttt{BubbleMesh} and ammunition \texttt{Bubbles}. When a client connects (player 2 clicks "find multiplayer"), we need to transmit and process this initial data.

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{GameModelPacket.png}
    \caption{UML class diagram for the \texttt{GameModelPacket} }
    \label{fig:gmpacket}
\end{figure}

After transmitting the \texttt{GameModelPacket} both players can start playing. Now we need to transmit all actions between the two clients. In the previous version we used some dedicated packets for this, but the implementation was incomplete. Now we have an advanced event handling system (section \ref{sec:evthdl}), and all we have to do is listen for a \texttt{GameEvent} being triggered in the active game panels, wrap it in an \texttt{EventPacket}, transmit it to the client (figure \ref{fig:connectorgamelistener}).

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{ConnectorGameListenerExtended.png}
    \caption{UML class diagram for the \texttt{ConnectorGameListener} }
    \label{fig:connectorgamelistener}
\end{figure}

When the client receives an \texttt{EventPacket}, it needs to update the \texttt{GameController}. Therefore we have made a \texttt{PacketListener} that listens for \texttt{EventPackets}, and then invokes the event on the \texttt{GameController} (figure \ref{fig:slavegamepacketlistener}).

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{SlaveGamePacketListener.png}
    \caption{UML class diagram for the \texttt{SlaveGamePacketListener} }
    \label{fig:slavegamepacketlistener}
\end{figure}

Now we have access to all required events in the multiplayer, which also allows the \texttt{GameModes} to work completely in multiplayer.


% ==============================
% 	POP ANIMATIONS
% ==============================
\subsection{Pop animations}
In the prvious sprint we already implemented two pop animmations for our requirement \texttt{C-193}, "When a bubble is popped, a pop animation should be played". But we could only play a the same pop animation for all bubbles. In this sprint we want to add multiple pop animations and give different bubbles different animations.

We already developed a \texttt{FallDownAnimation} and a \texttt{ShrinkAnimation}. We decided to give all normal bubbles the \texttt{ShrinkAnimation} and the \texttt{SteneBubble} the \texttt{FallDownAnimation}. For our \texttt{JokerBubble} we added the \texttt{ConfettiAnimation} class and for the \texttt{BombBubble} the \texttt{ExplosionAnimation} class.

To use different bubble animations for different bubbles we had to add a way to get the animation from the bubble. Therefore we added a method in the \texttt{Bubble} interface: \texttt{getAnimation() : FiniteAnimation}. In this method a \texttt{Bubble} returns the corresponding animation for when the (decorated) bubble pops. We also changed the way the animations are added to the game panel, we nog use the getAnimation method to get the annimation to be added. See Figure \ref{fig:addPopAnimations}.

% ==============================
% 	MULTIPLE LEVELS
% ==============================
\subsection{Multiple levels in game modes}

According to requirement \texttt{M-128} we want new levels (new maps of bubbles) to appear when a player finishes in the singleplayer mode (requirement \texttt{M-127}). In the previous version we could already load a specific \texttt{BubbleMesh} from a text file, but we only used this for the default map. In this version, we updated the game to support a variety maps.

\par{} First, we enrichted the \texttt{GameMode} with two new methods: \texttt{hasNextMap} and \texttt{getNextMap}. This basically makes the \texttt{GameMode} an \texttt{Iterator}. Each \texttt{GameMode} should at least provide one map through these methods, but has the ability to provide more maps.

\par{} Then we needed to call these methods to actually use the maps. This was a bit more difficult: in order to create a game, we first create a \texttt{GameModel} with a \texttt{BubbleMesh}. Therefore it already needs to have the \texttt{BubbleMesh} while we yet do not have access to the \texttt{GameController} nor the \texttt{GameMode} instance - which lives in the \texttt{GameController}.

\par{} Therefore we changed the design a bit. The \texttt{GameModel} contains the \texttt{BubbleMesh}, but not necessarily has to be instantiated with it. It is then provided through the \texttt{GameController}, which also has the ability to reload it when the game is won. See also the sequence diagram in figure \ref{fig:GameModeMap}.

\section{Wrap up - Reflection}

% ==========================
% Desgin Patterns
% ==========================
\subsection{Design Patterns}
Design patterns have been really valuable to our project. Some problems could easily be solved by implementing a design pattern. These design patterns improved our overal code quality, gave our project some structure and also made it easier to extend our game. Another big advantage was that the code was easier to understand for other project members because of the predefined way the design patterns should work.

The power-ups, for example, would have been implemented with one class for each combination of power-ups, which are resposible for all the behaviour. With the decorator pattern we where albe to split the responsibilities and combine multiple power-ups, like the sound bubble and drunk bubble. This made it easier to add new power ups and prevented a complicated inherentance or copying a lot of code.

We will definitely use design patterns in our future projects. During this project the desing patterns proved themself most useful. Furthermore, in future projects design patterns can be used from the beginning to provide an effective structure for the rest of the code.

\subsection{What we have learned about ourselves as a team}
We have learned the importance of UML and documentation in general. It can be very useful when communicating with team members.

\subsection{Practical Scrum}
We highly valued the use of Scrum in our project. The methodology enforces a very task based approach, which in our project lead to a very clear distrubution of tasks. This is a good thing in any project because it gets rid of the "i don't know what i should do"-overhead. The weekly reflection on the previous sprint were an important tool in creating the next sprint. They were a great reference in how much we could do in a week's time.


%We should more focus on the documentation the the actual programming for this kind of projects.
