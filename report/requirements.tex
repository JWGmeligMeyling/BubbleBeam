% 	REQUIREMENTS ANALYSIS
% ==========================================

\section{Requirements analysis}
We will develop a game like Frozen Bubble, with both singleplayer and multiplayer modes. Frozen Bubble is a Bubble shooter game, in which players have to shoot colored bubbles with a bubble gun. The bubble gun can be aimed and then shoot a bubble of a specific color. When the shot bubble hits a group of bubbles (two or more) of the same colour, these bubbles will pop and the player will receive an amount of points. When the player fails to hit a bubble of the same colour multiple times, a new row of bubbles will be inserted at the top, pushing the other bubbles. When one of these bubbles reaches the bottom of the screen, or all bubbles are shot, the game is over, and the score will be saved into a highscore board.
\par In the single player mode, players will face various levels with a different layout of the bubbles.
\par In the multiplayer mode, each player has his own canvas with a bubble gun and the bubbles to shoot.

% 	FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS
% ==========================================

\section{Functional requirements}
Each requirement is identified by a requirement identifier. This identifier consists of one or more marks pointing priority and status. For the priority status we use the \textit{MoSCoW Prioritisation} \citep{moscow} (\texttt{M} for must have, \texttt{S} for should have, \texttt{C} for could have, \texttt{W} for won't have) and a unique number.

% 	Note
%		Removed this sentence from the document as we are not using this
%
% Requirements that require further concideration are marked with \texttt{TBD}.

% =====================
% SECTION: MUST HAVE
% =====================
\subsection{Must have}

\begin{itemize}
  \item \texttt{M-113} The player should be able to start a game through the menu

  \item When the player starts the game...
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item \texttt{M-114} The canvas is filled with bubbles of certain colours (red, green, blue, purple, yellow and cyan), the colours are randomly distributed over the canvas
    \item \texttt{M-115} Bubbles in the canvas are snapped to the top of the canvas
  \end{enumerate}
  
  \item \texttt{M-116} The player should be able to aim the bubble cannon (\texttt{left} and \texttt{right}) using the mouse
  \item \texttt{M-117} The interface should show the colours for the next two bubbles to shoot (we will also refer to this as ammunition)

% ==========================================
%  BUBBLE SHOOT BEHAVIOUR
% ==========================================

  \item Behaviour for when a bubble is shot
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item \texttt{M-118} When a bubble hits a border of the canvas, it bounces
    \item \texttt{M-119} When a bubble hits another bubble, it snaps to it
    \item \texttt{M-120} When a bubble hits a group of bubbles of the same color, these bubbles should pop
    \item \texttt{M-121} When a bubble gets isolated from any bubble at the top of the canvas, it pops
    \item \texttt{M-122} When bubbles pop, points should be awarded to the player
    \item \texttt{M-123} When a bubble is popped, a pop animation should be played
    \item \texttt{M-124} When you do not succeed in popping bubbles, the player gets a penalty
    \item \texttt{M-125} For each a to be determined number of penalties a new row of bubbles with the remaining colours is inserted at the top, and other bubbles are shifted down
    \item \texttt{M-126} When a row of bubbles reaches the bottom of the canvas, the game is over
    \item \texttt{M-127} When all bubbles have popped, the game is finished
  \end{enumerate}
  
  \item There are two different modes to play:
  \begin{enumerate}
  
% ==========================================
% SINGLEPLAYER GAME REQUIREMENTS
% ==========================================
      \item \texttt{M-128} Singleplayer mode
      \begin{enumerate}
      	\item \texttt{M-129} A player wins the game when all bubbles have popped
        \item \texttt{M-130} A player loses the game when a bubble reaches the bottom of the canvas
        \item \texttt{M-131} When a player wins the game, a new game level (another canvas of bubbles) is presented
        \item \texttt{M-132} When a player loses the game, the score will be stored in the highscores and a highscore dialog will appear
        \item \texttt{M-133} When the player clicks the highscore button he should be able to see a list of highscores
      \end{enumerate}

% ==========================================
% MULTIPLAYER GAME REQUIREMENTS
% ==========================================

      \item \texttt{M-140} Multiplayer mode
      \begin{enumerate}
      	\item \texttt{M-141} In the multiplayer mode, each player has his own canvas with a bubble gun and the bubbles to shoot (split screen)
      	\item \texttt{M-142} Multiplayer mode can be started through the game menu
        \item \texttt{M-143} Another player can join a multiplayer game through the menu
      	\item \texttt{M-144} A player wins the game when all bubbles have popped
        \item \texttt{M-145} A player loses the game when a bubble reaches the bottom of the canvas
        \item \texttt{M-146} When a player wins the game, the other player automatically loses
        \item \texttt{M-147} When a player loses the game, the other player automatically wins
        \item \texttt{M-148} When a player exits or disconnects from a multiplayer game, the other player automatically wins
        
        \item \texttt{M-149} \textsc{Competitive multiplayer.} When a player manage to pop a few bubbles, a new bubble is inserted in the other players screen
      \end{enumerate}
  \end{enumerate}
  
  
% ==========================================
% ASSIGNMENT 3
% M-160: POWER UP BUBBLES
% ==========================================
  \item \texttt{M-160} Every once in a while a player should get a power-up bubble loaded up in the cannon which has special abilities:
  
        \begin{enumerate}
          \item \texttt{M-161} A \texttt{JokerBubble} should pop with a bubble of any color. If it is adjacent to less than two bubbles, the joker receives the colour of the bubble it collided with
          \item \texttt{M-162} A \texttt{BombBubble} should pop all bubbles in a certain radius around it after colliding
          \item \texttt{M-163} A \texttt{StoneBubble} can't be popped directly but only by popping the bubbles that connect it to the top
          \item \texttt{M-164} A \texttt{DrunkBubble} should move in a more difficult to predict way, so the user will have more difficulty accurately aiming the bubble
          \item \texttt{M-165} Sound effects should play when power-up bubbles pop or snap into the grid
          \item \texttt{M-166} Different power-up bubbles should have different pop animations
          \item \texttt{M-167} The \texttt{DrunkBubble} can be combined with any other \texttt{ColouredBubble} or power-up bubble
      \end{enumerate}

% END M-160: POWER UP BUBBLES
% ==========================================
  
  
% ==========================================
% ASSIGNMENT 2
% M-170: Logging functionality
% ==========================================
  
  \item \texttt{M-170} The game should have logging functionalty on which game events are logged
  
  The logger should have the following functionality:

          \item \texttt{M-171} Show a timestamp at which the event happend
          \item \texttt{M-172} Show a log priority \citep{apachelog} of the event (\textit{DEBUG}, \textit{INFO}, \textit{WARN}, \textit{ERROR})
          \item \texttt{M-173} Show in which class and at which line number the log is called
          \item \texttt{M-174} Ability to pass objects to a format string \citep{formatstring}. For example: \texttt{log("called on \%s", this)}.
          \item \texttt{M-174} Ability to pass throwables to the log function, which causes
          the Throwables stacktrace to be printed to the outputstream \citep{throwable}
          \item \texttt{M-175} Append log to system outputstream
      \end{enumerate} 
  
  	The following events should be logged:
