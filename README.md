## How to start this game.

1. Create a new binary of the game by executing `mvn clean package` in the root folder of the project.
2. In the folder `target` you will find a binary file called `game-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar`. This file contains all your code, config files and images, which are required to run the game.
3. The game can be started by executing this JAR file. You can either double click on it, or execute it from the command-line using the command: `java -jar game-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar`.
